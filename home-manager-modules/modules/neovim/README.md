# Intention

I want both the home-manager neovim ("A") and the nixvim neovim ("B") available
at the same time. The reason I want both is that getting B up-to-snuff requires
lots of editing, and that's too difficult when B is not yet up-to-snuff---a
bootstrapping problem.

## Hypothesis

Setting both A and B to enable in the nixos config makes it such that only A is
reachable. I *think* it's because while both are being built and put into the
current profile, A appears first when searching for nvim in the list of $PATH directories.

### Result
yep. B is in 10, while A is in 8.

     8  /etc/profiles/per-user/hippoid/bin
     9  /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin
    10  /run/current-system/sw/bin

# Fix
We can either get at B directly from its path, which is a kind-of cave-man
solution. A more debonair black-tie solution is to wrap a neovim package from
nixpkgs, and then change its name, call that package C. Then we set the nixvim
pkg attribute to be the new one. good plan.
